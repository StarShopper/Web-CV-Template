Practicing of writting layout from CV Trmplate.

I have some problems which I want to solve

First:![problem1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70586268/157978453-9a0d2104-d8e3-4246-9c9a-c4ac53e0f531.png)

To fix these divs into a straight line. And to reverse lang div into opposite side.

Second: ![problem2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70586268/157978729-fdc453bf-31cc-4973-9000-aa7476b0baec.png)

Fix the app__item with a one-word name to fit into other items. I used a hide symbol ".&.n.b.s.p;" to beautify an image (at first)

Next - Portfolio section.

See y'all around.
